Testing images can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/natural-images  
I recommend the airplane, flower, and person datasets.  
The photos are labeled, so it's easy to delete as many as you feel is appropriate (I kept 500 a piece).  

You will need:
- a new-ish version of Python 3 installed (sorry, I don't know how new)
- an install of Pillow: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
- anything else that this random library ends up needing on your machine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (sorry, docker failed with the previous 3 mosaic libraries because of opencv nonsense- and time is running out)
